In React Router Dom v6, the `useParams` hook might return incorrect or unexpected values if used within a component that is rendered conditionally or during server-side rendering (SSR).  This is because the parameters aren't available until the component mounts and the route matches. Accessing `useParams` too early can lead to undefined values, resulting in errors or unexpected behavior.  For instance:

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
function MyComponent() {
  const params = useParams();
  const id = params.id; // params.id might be undefined here

  // ... rest of the component ...
  return <div>ID: {id}</div>;
}
```

This issue may manifest as silent failures (undefined values) or explicit errors if your code attempts operations on `params.id` before it's available.
